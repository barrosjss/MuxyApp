# MUXYAPP

A new Flutter project created with FlutLab - https://flutlab.io

It is a reservation application, which represents a next-generation solution designed to optimize the reservation management of small and medium-sized businesses in the tourism sector, such as motels. Its objective is to provide administrators with an efficient tool that significantly improves the organization of reservations. With this application, administrators will save time, eliminating the need to search for information in calendars and physical agendas. In addition, you will benefit from a long-lasting record, which guarantees accurate and efficient tracking of all reservations made.

## Functional Requirements

- Make reservation: The administrator(s) must be able to make reservations for any of the rooms offered by the business, choosing the date, time, room number, guest name, contact information, etc.

- View Reservations: Administrators must have access to an interface that displays all existing reservations. Users should be able to see full details of each reservation, including dates and guest information.

- Update Reservation: Authorized users must have the ability to make changes to existing reservations. The application should allow updating of details such as reservation dates, number of rooms, guest information, etc.

- Delete Reservation: Authorized users must be able to cancel an existing reservation. A confirmation or warning message must be generated before proceeding with the deletion to prevent accidental cancellation of reservations.

- Close Reservation (Automatic): The application must have the ability to automatically close a reservation once the reservation end time has passed.
